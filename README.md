## Tech Stack

#### Foundation

Using **[GatsbyJs](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)** the website's **[React](https://github.com/facebook/react)** code is rendered to static HTML at built time. Once a client visits the page, a JavaScript bundle is loaded asynchronously.

#### Styling

Styling is done using css/scss.

## Continuous Deployment

As soon as changes are merged into the `master` branch, the page will automatically be built by **[Netlify](https://netlify.com)**.
